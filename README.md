#  Mood Tracker

The aim of the application is to track your mood along with the activities that affects it. Eventually you get a database with your mood and activities and you get a sense of how much each activity affect your mood. You can then cut the activities that negatively affect your mood or increase the ones that improves your mood. 

The application will be very easy to use where you can enter your daily entry without any lengthy processes or writing anything, in a few clicks.

## Features of the application

- Login
- Screen where you select your mood
- Screen where you select activities you did throughout the day.
- Home screen/ Dashboard
- Local data persistence
- Backing up data using iCloud Framework

## Future Scope

- Reminder for daily entry
- Extend the application to Apple Watch
- Extend the application to Apple TV
- Graph data

## Development Schedule

The plan is to finish the application in 7-8 Weeks as this project is being worked on along with 3 other courses I am taking. Here is an approximate timeline:

- **Week 1**: Planning the flow of application and image assets
- **Week 2**: Login
