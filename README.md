#  Mood Tracker

The aim of the application is to track your mood along with the activities that affects it. Eventually you get a database with your mood and activities and you get a sense of how much each activity affect your mood. You can then cut the activities that negatively affect your mood or increase the ones that improves your mood. 

The application will be very easy to use where you can enter your daily entry without any lengthy processes or writing anything, in a few clicks.
